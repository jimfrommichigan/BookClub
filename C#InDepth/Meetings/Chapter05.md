# Chapter 05 - Writing Asynchronous Code Meeting Notes

## Named Parameters

Discussed how optional, named parameters can be helpful for extending an API. Instead of breaking an existing method you can simply add an optional parameter to it and provide a default value. That way that anyone using your API won't have their calls broken, but new callers can still utilize the new feature.

Local functions were also discussed; they haven't been mentioned in this book yet (they will be), but they're essentially just methods that are scoped only to the method they are defined within.

## COM Interoperability

Lyn has worked with a project that she had to create an Excel Spreadsheet for and it was a pain; she says "don't do it if you don't have to!." There are no instances (that we know of) at LMCU anymore.

There's some PDF modifying code for Wire Requests that Kent feels is messy and seems to be error prone. Dan then said something that I couldn't understand...

## Generic Variance

Some discussion about the mathematical implications of covariance and contravariance. Most of the time you won't even notice you're using this feature.

## Prep for Chapter 5

It's about synchronous code and is quite lengthy. She's not sure whether we should break it up or power through it. Lyn and Mike have already read it so it's up to the rest of the group on whether to break it up or not. Lyn suggests that if she were to break it up she would stop after 5.5, since 5.6 talks more about using the features as opposed to what the features are; bringing it all together.

Lyn mentioned the challenge question(s) that Mike wrote and mentioned that they're pretty easy to complete. She isn't going to make it required, but may be able to think of some reward for those that do finish (a big star was mentioned).
