# Challenge Question - Dynamics

Using the `CommentsService` provided, output the title of the **5** comments that were added to post 13 (postId = 13). You can view the raw data that will be returned from the api via <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments>.

There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but try to solve it using the `dynamic` keyword, and don't create any additional classes for interpreting the data. This is an attempt to show how easy `dynamic` can be to use and how it can make tedious tasks trivial.

Make a fork of this code or download it to your personal machine and try it out!
